# digtick
digtick (the mnemonic for "dig tk", i.e., digital toolkit) is a
command-line-tool tool for creating and solving problems in digital systems.
The primary target audience are educators (who can use it to create and
validate exam questions) as well as students who want to improve their skills.
It allows you to specify, parse and reformat Boolean equations (e.g., in LaTeX
form for easy inclusion in documents). It can create tables from a given
Boolean expression and rendering Karnaugh–Veitch (KV) maps with an arbitrary
number of variables. It can check Boolean equations for equivalance.  A
Quine-McCluskey implementation is used to minify expressions.


## Boolean expression syntax
digtick accepts a pragmatic Boolean syntax that matches what students often
write on paper, while still being unambiguous and machine-parseable. Variables
follow a typical identifier pattern (e.g. `A`, `B`, `clk`). Constants are `0`
and `1`.

You can express `OR` as `+` or `|`, `AND` as `*` or `&`, and XOR as `^`.
Negation can be written as `!`, `~`, or `-` prefix. The parser also accepts
NAND `@` and NOR `%` as explicit operators.

Note that neither NAND nor NOR are associative. Their precendence in parsing is
as following, from strongest to weakest:

  1. Parenthesis
  2. NOT
  3. AND
  4. NAND
  5. OR, XOR, NOR

Note that AND has higher precedence than NOR. This is so that the expression

```
A @ B C
```

is interpreted on how it is "naturally" read because of implicit AND as

```
A @ (B C)
```

instead of what would be correct if AND and NAND had same precedence:

```
(A @ B) C
```

Parentheses work as expected for grouping. Contrary to commonly used parsers,
the parser of `digtick` treats parenthesis as a syntactical element, which
means they are preserved in the AST. The intention is to allow for expressions
with unnecessary parenthesis to generate exam questions (students should know
that `A + (B + C))` is identical to `A + B + C` without the parser eating away
the exam question):

```
$ digtick parse '(((((A | (B))))))'
(((((A + (B))))))
```

For convenience of notation, `AND` is implicit: adjacency separated by
whitespace counts as `AND`:

```
$ digtick parse 'A B C + A !B C + C !A'
A B C + A !B C + C !A
```

By default, this is also implemented this way in the output, but many commands
allow specifying a particular format, including the `--no-implicit-and` option:

```
$ digtick parse --no-implicit-and 'A B C + A !B C + C !A'
A * B * C + A * !B * C + C * !A
```

There are multiple output options, e.g. a Unicode renderer:

```
$ digtick parse --format pretty-text 'A B C + A !B C + C !A'
A B C ∨ A B̅ C ∨ C A̅
```


## Operator precedence within Python
Note that, when importing `digtick` and using it to perform changes under the
hood, you can also naturally use the overloaded operators. They also automatically convert
strings and integers to variables and constants. Example:

```python3
from digtick.ExpressionParser import Variable
(A, B, C) = (Variable("A"), Variable("B"), Variable("C"))
print(~((A | B) & C))
>>> [![[A + B] * C]]
```

Note that also the `@` and `%` operators are overloaded to provide NAND and
NOR, but with the caveat that the operator precedence within Python is
different than our parsing precedence!

```python3
from digtick.ExpressionParser import Variable
(A, B, C) = (Variable("A"), Variable("B"), Variable("C"))
print(A @ B & C == (A @ B) & C)
>>> True
```


## Truth table format
There is a human-readable truth table format which uses Unicode characters for
pretty viewing in a terminal and the machine-readable format which is
tab-separated. The latter is the default output variant and the only variant
which can be used as input:

```
$ digtick make-table 'A B C + A !B C + C !A'
A	B	C
0	0	0	0
0	0	1	1
0	1	0	0
0	1	1	1
1	0	0	0
1	0	1	1
1	1	0	0
1	1	1	1

$ digtick make-table --format pretty 'A B C + A !B C + C !A'
┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ A │ B │ C │   │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│ 0 │ 0 │ 0 │ 0 │
│ 0 │ 0 │ 1 │ 1 │
│ 0 │ 1 │ 0 │ 0 │
│ 0 │ 1 │ 1 │ 1 │
│ 1 │ 0 │ 0 │ 0 │
│ 1 │ 0 │ 1 │ 1 │
│ 1 │ 1 │ 0 │ 0 │
│ 1 │ 1 │ 1 │ 1 │
└───┴───┴───┴───┘
```

Note that commands which accept truth table inputs can all have the filename
omitted and will then read from stdin. This allows for easy piping of commands:

```
$ digtick make-table 'A B C + A !B C + C !A' | digtick synth
CDNF: !A !B C + !A B C + A !B C + A B C
CCNF: (A + B + C) (A + !B + C) (!A + B + C) (!A + !B + C)
DNF : C
CNF : (C)
```

## Timing diagram format
For timing diagrams, the general format is this:

```
# Comment, this will be ignored
A  = 01010101010101010
!B = 10101010101010101
```

This shows two signals, A and !B. Characters that can be used are:

  - `0`/`1`: LOW or HIGH
  - `:`: both LOW and HIGH (invalid/ambiguous state)
  - `!`: LOW -> HIGH and HIGH -> LOW transition simultaneous (only valid within
    `:` blocks to indicate a signal may change)
  - `Z`: High impedance (middle line)
  - `|`: Marker line at that exact point. May also be a labeled marker by using
    `|'text'`.
  - `_`: Empty clock cycle

Whitespace is ignored.

## "parse": parse and reformat Boolean expressions
`parse` parses an equation and outputs it in a different format, such as LaTeX.
It takes care that in overline-style negation of literals the overline does
*not* automatically carry over to the next character (this is an annoying LaTeX
default, unfortunately, and results in a non-equivalent equation):

```
$ digtick parse --format tex-tech '!A !B'
\overline{\textnormal{A}} \ \overline{\textnormal{B}}
$ digtick parse --format tex-tech '!(A B)'
\overline{(\textnormal{A} \ \textnormal{B})}
```

Note that also the mathematical variant of symbols can be used:

```
$ digtick parse --format tex-math '!(A B)'
\neg \textnormal{A} \ \neg \textnormal{B}
```

## "make-table": generate a truth table from an expression
`make-table` evaluates a Boolean expression over all input combinations and
prints a truth table. An optional second expression can be used to mark “don't
care” output positions (`*`). Wherever the “don't care” expression evaluates to
1, the output is printed as `*` instead of `0` or `1`.

```
$ digtick make-table 'A + B !C' 'A !B'
A	B	C
0	0	0	0
0	0	1	0
0	1	0	1
0	1	1	0
1	0	0	*
1	0	1	*
1	1	0	1
1	1	1	1
```


## "print-table": read and print a table file
`print-table` reads a TSV truth table and prints it back in either plain TSV
form or a formatted view. If your table doesn't define every input combination,
you can decide how missing patterns should be treated. In the default strict
mode, missing patterns are considered an error; in the relaxed modes, missing
patterns are filled as `0`, `1`, or `*`.

```
$ digtick make-table 'A + B !C' 'A !B' | \
  head -n 4 | \
  digtick print-table -f pretty --unused-value-is '*'
┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ A │ B │ C │   │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│ 0 │ 0 │ 0 │ 0 │
│ 0 │ 0 │ 1 │ 0 │
│ 0 │ 1 │ 0 │ 1 │
│ 0 │ 1 │ 1 │ * │
│ 1 │ 0 │ 0 │ * │
│ 1 │ 0 │ 1 │ * │
│ 1 │ 1 │ 0 │ * │
│ 1 │ 1 │ 1 │ * │
└───┴───┴───┴───┘
```


## "kv": render a Karnaugh–Veitch map from a table
`kv` takes a truth table and lays it out as a KV map. There are multiple ways
to create a KV map which are all. As an educator, I usually have the policy
that my students need not adhere to the format taught in my lectures, but may
choose a different format as long as it produces correct output. This puts the
burden of verification on me, which is cumbersome. For this purpose, this
rendering command accepts a number of different parameters that influence the
way the KV diagram is printed.

```
$ digtick make-table 'A B !C + B D + !C A' 'B !A D + A B C D' >exam1.txt
$ digtick kv exam1.txt
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│     │ A̅ B̅ │ A B̅ │ A B │ A̅ B │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ C̅ D̅ │  0  │  1  │  1  │  0  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ C D̅ │  0  │  0  │  0  │  0  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ C D │  0  │  0  │  *  │  *  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ C̅ D │  0  │  1  │  1  │  *  │
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘

$ digtick kv exam1.txt -o DCBA --x-offset 1 --y-invert
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│     │ C̅ D │ C D │ C D̅ │ C̅ D̅ │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ A̅ B̅ │  0  │  0  │  0  │  0  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ A B̅ │  1  │  0  │  0  │  1  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ A B │  1  │  *  │  0  │  1  │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ A̅ B │  *  │  *  │  0  │  0  │
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

This makes it much easier to verify solutions for their correctness, regardless
of which format the student chose.


## "synthesize": minimize/synthesize expressions from a truth table
`synthesize` reads a truth table and prints canonical forms (CDNF/CCNF) as well
as minimized forms (DNF/CNF) produced via Quine-McCluskey.

```
$ digtick synth exam1.txt
CDNF: A !B !C !D + A !B !C D + A B !C !D + A B !C D
CCNF: (A + B + C + D) (A + B + C + !D) (A + B + !C + D) (A + B + !C + !D) (A + !B + C + D) (A + !B + !C + D) (!A + B + !C + D) (!A + B + !C + !D) (!A + !B + !C + D)
DNF : A !C + B D
CNF : (!C) (A)
```

## "equal": check whether two expressions are equivalent
`equal` compares two Boolean expressions by evaluating them over all possible
input assignments of the involved variables. If they are equivalent, it reports
success. If they differ, it prints a counterexample assignment.

```
$ digtick eq 'A @ B @ C' 'A @ (B @ C)'
Not equal: {'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 1} gives 0 on LHS but 1 on RHS

$ digtick eq 'A B C + C !D B + B C' 'B C'
Expressions equal.
```

Note that `digtick` also supports checking a whole file for equivalence in the `parse` command. For example, say you have generated an exam and are preparing the reference solution, in which you are performing tiny simplification steps each line:

```
$ cat exam2.txt
A B C + B C (A + D) + B A !D + F (E + !F)
A B C + B C A + B C D + B A !D + F (E + !F)
A B C + B C A + B C D + B A !D + F E + F !F
A B C + B C A + B C D + B A !D
B C A + B C D + B A !D
B (C A + C D + A !D)
B (C D + A !D)
```

Did you spot my error? A simple omission that changes the whole formula:

```
$ digtick parse --read-as-filename --validate-equivalence exam2.txt
A B C + B C (A + D) + B A !D + F (E + !F)
A B C + B C A + B C D + B A !D + F (E + !F)
A B C + B C A + B C D + B A !D + F E + F !F
A B C + B C A + B C D + B A !D
Warning: expression "A * B * C + B * C * A + B * C * D + B * A * !D + F * E + F * !F" on line 3 is not equivalent to expression "A * B * C + B * C * A + B * C * D + B * A * !D" on line 4.
B C A + B C D + B A !D
B (C A + C D + A !D)
B (C D + A !D)
There were validation errors, some of the equations are not equivalent to each other.
```

Once you corrected the mistake, you can then, for example, render as TeX -- I'm
sure you'll agree that this output is a write-only format not intended for
human consumption:

```
\textnormal{A} \ \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ (\textnormal{A} \vee \textnormal{D}) \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{A} \ \overline{\textnormal{D}} \vee \textnormal{F} \ (\textnormal{E} \vee \overline{\textnormal{F}})
\textnormal{A} \ \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{A} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{D} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{A} \ \overline{\textnormal{D}} \vee \textnormal{F} \ (\textnormal{E} \vee \overline{\textnormal{F}})
\textnormal{A} \ \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{A} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{D} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{A} \ \overline{\textnormal{D}} \vee \textnormal{F} \ \textnormal{E} \vee \textnormal{F} \ \overline{\textnormal{F}}
\textnormal{A} \ \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{A} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{D} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{A} \ \overline{\textnormal{D}} \vee \textnormal{F} \ \textnormal{E}
\textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{A} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{D} \vee \textnormal{B} \ \textnormal{A} \ \overline{\textnormal{D}} \vee \textnormal{F} \ \textnormal{E}
\textnormal{B} \ (\textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{A} \vee \textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{D} \vee \textnormal{A} \ \overline{\textnormal{D}}) \vee \textnormal{F} \ \textnormal{E}
\textnormal{B} \ (\textnormal{C} \ \textnormal{D} \vee \textnormal{A} \ \overline{\textnormal{D}}) \vee \textnormal{F} \ \textnormal{E}
```

## "random-expr": generate a random Boolean expression
`random-expr` generates a random expression over a specified number of
variables that has a certain "complexity" according to some metric (currently,
number of characters in native format). It automatically simplifies the
randomized equations and checks that the minimized variant is not below another
complexity metric (so that tautologies are not created):

```
$ digtick random-expr 4 60
Expression: !((!B !C D A + A C)) (!C) !B !C (!D + !C) + (!C + D) B C D A + !B !A
Simplified: !B !C !D + !A !B + A B C D
```


## "random-table": generate a random truth table
`random-table` creates a truth table for a specified number of variables,
randomly choosing output values according to configured probabilities. By
default the output distribution is 40% zeros, 40% ones, and the remainder
don't-cares. You can adjust the zero/one percentages; whatever remains after
those is implicitly treated as `*`.

```
$ digtick random-table -0 30 -1 50 3
A	B	C
0	0	0	0
0	0	1	1
0	1	0	*
0	1	1	*
1	0	0	1
1	0	1	1
1	1	0	1
1	1	1	0
```


## "transform": Transform a Boolean expression
`transform` allows you to input a Boolean expression and have it converted into
NAND or NOR logic, i.e., replacing all gates exclusively by NAND or NOR.
Examples:

```
$ digtick transform -t nand 'A ^ B'
((A @ 1) @ B) @ (A @ (B @ 1))

$ digtick transform -t nor 'A ^ !B'
((A % ((B % 0) % 0)) % ((A % 0) % (B % 0)) % 0)
```

Note that, as stated above, `@` is shortcut notation for NAND while `%` stands
for NOR.


## "dtd-create": Create a digital timing diagram
`dtd-create` generates timing-diagram source text (a compact, line-based
format) for common sequential devices typically used in exam exercises: SR-NAND
flipflops, D-flipflops, JK- or JK-MS-flipflops. It produces randomized inputs
(reproducible via a seed), simulates the device, and prints input/output
waveforms.

To do this, you can simply invoke the command and it will generate a random
timing diagram (by default of a SR-NAND-FF):

```
$ digtick dtd-create
# Random seed: 8910607998
!S = 0|'S'0|'R'11|0|'🗲'111|00|'R'111111|'S'0000|00|'S'00000111|'R'11
!R = 0    1    00 0    111 00    000001    1111 00    11111111    01
Q  = 1    1    00 1    000 11    000000    1111 11    11111111    00
!Q = 1    0    11 1    111 11    111111    0000 11    00000000    11
```

As you can see, it created a diagram along with notational markers that show
when the flipflop was set, when it was reset and where an illegal state
transition occurred. Note that for the SR-NAND-FF it is *not* illegal for both
inputs to become active (i.e., LOW) at the same time, this is well-defined
behavior. Undefined behavior occurs only when out of this state there is a
simultaneous transition into the "keep" state (both inputs inactive, i.e.,
HIGH).


# "dtd-render": render timing diagram data to SVG
`dtd-render` reads timing-diagram source text (from a file or stdin) and
renders it as an SVG. As an example, consider the example shown before in
`dtd-create`. Let us reproduce it from its pseudo-random seed and render it:

```
$ digtick dtd-create -s 8910607998 | digtick dtd-render -o docs/timing_diagram.png
```

Will create the file `docs/timing_diagram.svg` which you can see here (note
that here, a PNG-conversion is shown which is why it looks fuzzy/washed out --
the original is crystal clear):

![SR Flipflop timing diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johndoe31415/digtick/main/docs/timing_diagram.png)

Note that the two-step process makes it exceptionally easy to create random
diagrams until you find one that you like, use this as the reference solution
for an exam, edit the test file and clear out the signals you want students to
fill in, then render that again.

Also note that the created SVG supports layers so it is easy to retroactively
disable, for example, labels or tick markers.

Another example is this timing diagram, showing tri-state states:

```
!CS = 1111|'start'000000        00000000000000000000        00001111111
SCK = 0000        000000|'bit 1'10101010101011110000|'bit 8'11001111111
DAT = ZZZZ        ::::::        !:!:!:!:!:!:!:::::::        !:::ZZZZZZZ
```

Which renders as:

![Made-up communication diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johndoe31415/digtick/main/docs/other_diagram.png)
